This repository demonstrates a common Python error: a RecursionError caused by improper handling of base cases in recursive functions. The `factorial` function, when called with a negative number, enters an infinite recursive loop because the base case (`n == 0`) is never reached. This results in a `RecursionError`. The solution shows how to add error handling to prevent this issue.
